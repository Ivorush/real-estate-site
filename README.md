Real estate websites bring convenience to buyers and exposure to sellers. 
Buyers can view hundreds of property images, videos, and features before they ever need to schedule a live tour. 
Sellers who post their homes on these sites benefit for the same reason; hundreds or thousands of prospective buyers can view their home online without needing to walk through.

The other major purpose real estate websites serve is as a marketing channel for the professional service providers that contribute to the transaction.
Realtors, mortgage professionals, banks, and inspectors can advertise on the website to generate leads.
